# Japanese in One Year Converter
This is probably not useful to literally anyone else, but I was trying to read this one really long, inconsistently formatted (in terms of header levels) Google Doc and wanted a side navigation bar to jump between sections, so I wrote this little tool. I don't have the link on hand now, but if for whatever reason you want to test this out, google around for it and you can find the original document. It's a google doc linked from a Reddit post. It may or may not have been edited since the version I used for this.

To use this, download the original document from Google Docs as a HTML site, and put the extracted directory under this directory, named "original".


Run `npm run convert` to create the converted site. Run `npm run site` to host the site, which will be available on port 8086.
